            Google defnes a keyword as an isolated word or phrase that provides
            concise high-level information about content to readers . With the
            increasing amount of data, users need more resources and time to
            understand content. Keywords make it easier to understand the
            meaning of a text in fewer words.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, keywords summarize the key points presented in the text.
            When searching for information on search engines, keywords play a
            signifcant role in fnding relevant content. Keywords are the
            mostinformative part of a text; they are the most prominent words in
            the text and describe its content. Keywords are necessary in
            situations involving huge amounts of text data that need to be
            processed automatically. Keywords are widely used in document
            summarization, indexing, categorization, and clustering of huge
            datasets. Many scientifc publications contain keyword lists that
            have been explicitly assigned by their authors. Other documents,
            however, have not been assigned keywords . As webpages are
            constantly updated, it is difcult to create keywords manually.
            Manual keyword assignment is labor intensive, time consuming, and
            error prone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Specialized curators use fxed taxonomies for manual keyword
            generation, but in some cases, the keywords chosen by the author are
            not sufciently comprehensive and accurate. Without high-quality
            keywords, users fail to catch relevant information . Keywords ofer
            readers a concise high-level summary of a documents content, thereby
            improving their understanding of that text. Keywords are the most
            relevant and important indicator for users seeking to grasp the
            fundamentals of a topic when scanning or skimming an article.
            Keyword extraction is a basic step in many text-mining and natural
            language processing (NLP) techniques, including text summarization,
            information retrieval, topic modeling, clustering, and content-based
            advertisement systems. Finding the relevant webpages, a user is
            seeking is often a challenging task for which representative
            keywords or keyphrases.
          </p>

          <p>
            This article addresses the issue of automatic extracting keywords
            from webpages. The majority of existing keyword extraction methods
            use language-dependent Natural Language Processing (NLP) based
            techniques, including Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, stemming, and
            lemmatization, which makes it complex to generalize a method for
            different languages. The main purpose of the research is to extract
            only those language-independent features of web pages in order to
            find a method that can be applied in different languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far, studies on language-independent approaches have been limited
            because they usually perform worse than methods that take advantage
            of linguistic features. Extracting keywords from web documents
            involves two main challenges: the first is the presence of noise and
            irrelevant data such as navigation bars, menus, comments and
            advertisements and the second consists in the presence of multiple
            topics and multiple languages. Therefore, it is very important to
            have a general keyword extraction method that can extract keywords
            without relying on any specific language.
          </p>

          <p>
            addresses the challenges of keyword extraction by developing and
            testing four new techniques, both language-dependent and
            language-independent as well as supervised and unsupervised. Special
            attention is paid to finding the most relevant features for
            identifying good keyword and keyphrase candidates. The work deals
            with statistical, linguistic, and structural features as well as
            their combinations. This diversity of approaches serves the
            pragmatic overall goal of finding the best available methods by
            assessing the relative performances of the newly developed as well
            as existing methods on a number of different datasets.
          </p>

            For this purpose the author proposes four new automatic keyword
            extraction methods for webpages: Hrank, D-rank, WebRank, and
            ACI-rank

            Hrank is the only language-dependent method; the other three are
            language independent. The Hrank method, is an unsupervised method of
            keyword extraction from a single webpage. This method uses a
            hierarchical clustering of the candidate words (nouns, adjectives
            and verbs) based on their semantic relatedness score using WordNet.
            I note that Hrank improved the performance of the CLRank method
            after adding other POS such as adjectives and verbs.

            work deals with webpage keyword extraction, which is crucial for the
            information retrieval task performed by search engines browsing
            through the internet. As such, keyword extraction is a specific kind
            of information extraction task, where the use of a natural language,
            or even several languages, poses severe challenges. To conquer these
            challenges, appropriate natural language processing (NLP) techniques
            have to be applied. As the method is dealing with webpages, the task
            is further complicated by the varying structure and layout of the
            pages. Even if Google search is widely and successfully used by a
            vast number of people for all so many purposes, the search results
            are often far from optimal, and processing natural language
            documents remain challenging.
          </p>
          <p>
            The D-rank method is an unsupervised method where the candidate
            keywords were ranked based on their position in the content after
            extracting their features from the DOM structure. The author tested
            the proposed method on a dataset of webpages in three languages:
            English, Finnish, and German.

            The WebRank method is a supervised method that extends the D-rank
            method by analyzing different classifiers to see how they performed
            automatically with those features. After testing the proposed
            method, the author found that among the classifiers, the best
            results are obtained with random forest, provided an improvement up
            27.89% compared to the best existing method.

        <h2>ACI-RANK</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            The fourth proposed method, ACI-rank, performs a systematic
            comparison of methods for automatic keyword extraction from web
            pages, based on three different types of features: statistical,
            structural, and linguistic. One of the key results of the analysis
            are that stopword removal and others preprocessing steps are the
            most important. Another important conclusion resulting from the
            testing of the method consists in the fact that linguistic features
            help extract keywords that are more relevant to the content of the
            webpage. I note that among the unsupervised methods, the proposed
            ACI-rank works better (0.47) and is close to the supervised method
            WebRank (0.50) according to the soft measure.
